# College of Fortune
Bards of the College of Fortune believe that any sentient being is moved by but a simple thing, riches. For there’s no music that rivals the clinking of platinum, nor sight more tempting than a handful of well-cut diamonds on the table.

And so, bards of the College of Fortune traverse the lands in search of high-paying jobs, hidden treasure troves or any conflict they can get spoils from.
