# College of Orchestrators
While all bards collect stories and lore for their craft, some are just not convinced with its quality. After all, what fate decrees is usually mediocre.  
The members of the College of Orchestrators take upon themselves to ensure their stories are all worth listening, have a spoonful of drama and the right amount of ... *zazz*.  

## Bonus Proficiencies
*3rd level*

When you join the College of Orchestrators, you gain proficiency with crossbows and firearms, and with Performance skill checks.  

## Every Moment Matters
*3rd level*

You take it upon itself to transform life into a piece of art. You may grant Bardic Inspiration to yourself, and you may add it to your damage rolls.
Your attacks can use your Charisma modifier instead of the usual modifier, but doing so makes you glaringly obvious to anyone present.
This prevents Surprise and Stealth attacks, and makes it prohibitively difficult for you to Hide on this or the next turn.

## Deathly Flourish
*6th level*  
Your kills are no longer ugly. Bodies you leave bled in beautiful, flowery patterns. The bones fall rattling musically. Spiritual entities dissipate in a flash of color.

As a bonus action, after you kill an enemy, you may grant Bardic Inspiration to an ally without consuming a Bardic Inspiration die, twice per short rest.

## Death as an Opera:
*14th level*

Learn how to wield your weapons for maximum drama. Your performance shall leave no one unfazed... nor alive.

The necessary roll for a crit decreases by 4 at the end of every round you have not critically struck. This bonus resets to zero when scoring a crit.
