# Domain of Seduction
## Ethereal Grace
Starting at 1st level when you choose this domain, you gain the blessing of Ethereal Grace. Once per short rest, as an action, you can display your radiant beauty, giving up to 3 targets of your choosing, including yourself, advantage on a single Cha roll for 1 hour.

Additionally, you do not display signs of aging past your prime, until your very last years.

## Graceful Performance
Starting at 1st level when you choose this domain, gain proficiency in one musical instrument or dance of your choosing.

## Channel Divinity: Beguile
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to seduce your target.

As an action, become the source of your target's desire, whatever that might be, which will only be seen by yourself and your target. Your target must pass a Wisdom saving throw against your spell modifier, and do so with disadvantage if their mental state has recently been thrown into disarray (with effects such as Charm, a breakup, ...). This is an illusory effect.

A target that fails its saving throw is deprived from their will to act for a minute, being unable to take any action that isn't for self-preservation (such as running away from a flame). They may repeat their saving throw at the beginning of the following turns.

## Enticing Performance
Starting at 6th level, gain proficiency in another musical instrument or dance of your choosing.

You may use your performing skills to cast the Charm Person spell as a ritual on up to five targets of your choosing, within 30ft and direct sight of you. No magic will be perciveable untill the ritual is completed.

## Imbue Courage
Starting at 6th level, having you as a companion grants a boost of confidence. You can add your Charisma modifier to up to 10 targets of your choosing as temporary HP after finishing a 10 minute performance, lasting for 12 hours. You require a long rest before using this feature again.

## Love Is Pain

## Avatar of Seduction
