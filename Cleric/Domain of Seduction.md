# Domain of Seduction
## Ethereal Grace
Starting at level 1 when you choose this domain, you gain the blessing of Ethereal Grace. Once per long rest, as an action, you can display your radiant beauty, giving up to 5 targets of your choosing, including yourself, advantage on a single Cha roll for 30 minutes.

Additionally, you do not display signs of aging past your prime, until your very last years. This affects you only externally at lower levels, but becomes more prevalent the higher your cleric level.

## Channel Divinity: Beguile
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to seduce your target.

As an action, become the source of your target's desire, whatever that might be, which will only be seen by yourself and your target. Your target must pass a Wisdom saving throw against your spell modifier, and do so with disadvantage if their mental state has recently been thrown into disarray (with effects such as Charm, a breakup, ...). A target that fails its saving throw is deprived from their will to act for three turns, and may repeat their saving throw at the beginning of the following turns.

## Channel Divinity: Sublime
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to become surrounded with an halo of exuberance and beauty.

As an action, you force all creatures within 100 feet of you with line of sight to make Charisma saving throws. Each creature that fails this save is charmed by you, will lose Concentration and will have disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom throws.

## Love Is Pain
Starting at 8th level, when conditions you've applied expire, they deal damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Avatar of Seduction
Starting at 17th level, you become an avatar of desire and seduction. You can affect up to three targets when you use Beguile. The range of Sublime is doubled and no longer requires line of sight.

The damage from Love Is Pain is also doubled.
