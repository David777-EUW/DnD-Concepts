# Myrmidon
Only the fiercest fighters survive the arena. Among these, the Myrmidon rises triumphant, for whom there's no obstacle that cannot be broken through.

## Wind Becomes Lightning
*3rd level*
Your melee weapon fighting has equal amounts of precision and sheer aggression.
When you attack with a melee weapon, you can perform a lightning fast thrust with it, attacking all enemies in a 20ft line.
You can use this feature once per turn.

## Always Forward
*7th level*
Constant battle has steeled your resolve; any obstacle is one more you'll soon overcome.
You gain 10ft of movement speed, and you may always move 5ft on any direction on your turn as long as you aren't Unconscious or Petrified.

## Mind Blank
*7th level*
Constantly hanging between life and death puts the mind to impossible levels of stress, requiring the performance of other tasks to entertain the mind.
Gain proficiency on one Intelligence skill check of your choice.

## Heightened Awareness
*10th level*
You've learned to survive and steer off danger in the midst of a fray.
You gain a +1 bonus to AC and proficiency with Dexterity saving throws.
If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with a saving throw of your choice.

## Press The Assault
*15th level*
There's no better time than right now to attack when the enemy shows their weak spots.
As a reaction to an enemy becoming Incapacitated (also Paralyzed, Petrified, Stunned or Unconscious) within 20ft of you, you can close the gap and perform a melee attack against them.
Doing so restores your reaction.
You can only restore your reaction this way once before each of your turns.

## Overwhelm The Odds
*18th level*
Being surrounded gets you to overcome your limits, to a point not even the odds can stand against you.
Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 per every 2 hostile creatures within 20ft of you, up to +3 proficiency bonus with 6 or more hostile creatures within range.
