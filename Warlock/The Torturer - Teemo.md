# The Torturer
You have made a pact with a being that once wreaked havoc in the mortal world, so heinous that multiple deities once united to banish it.
It feeds upon the pain and suffering it causes on beings it deems inferior, and stops at nothing.

Some tales tell a different story, however.
The gods, envious of a certain adorable creature who was slowly gathering an entourage of followers, wreathed everything from it, and it turned into a cruel shadow of what once was.

Shall you pledge your soul to it, it shall grant you power to spread suffering in its name.
In exchange, it shall require you to feed it with the cries of your victims, in preparation of its imminent return.

If you kill an enemy, or an enemy you attacked on your last turn dies, all enemies within 40 ft of you will hear an unearthy laughter.
Enemies affected by this must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC or suffer 1d6 psychic damage.

## Feast upon Suffering
*1st level*

Whenever the victims of your Warlock spells or features react verbally to the pain and suffering these inflict, it is only heard by you and your patron.

## No-Rule Fighting

You get the Toxic Shot as an extra invocation. If you do not have Eldritch Blast, gain instead an invocation of your choosing.

### Toxic Shot
When using Eldritch Blast as an action, you can attack one of its targets as a bonus action.
On hit, the target must make a Constitution save throw against your spell DC or be Poisoned for 1 minute.

## Guerrilla Warfare
*10th level*

When Psychological Warfare triggers, you can take the Hide action as a free action, as long as you have some form of cover or obscuring.

## Noxious Traps
*14th level*

You gain the ability to spend 5 minutes to condense the hatred and cruelty of your patron in the form you choose, with a size between 1 and 2 sq ft.
You may do so a number of times equal to your proficiency, with long rests restoring all usages and dissipating your current traps, whether held or placed.

You can use an action to toss one such trap to an unnoccupied space within 20 ft of you, where it becomes invisible at the end of your turn, and lasts for 1h.
If a creature steps on it or ends its turn withing 5 ft, the trap explodes, affecting all enemies within 10 ft.
Affected enemies take 4d10 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell CD or be Poisoned and take 1d8 poison damage at the end of their turn for 1 minute.
